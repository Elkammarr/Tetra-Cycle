# Tetra-Cycle
This application automatically detects water type and calculates water treatment steps based on analysis of heavy metal concentrations, sludge percentage, and more. Advanced techniques such as Brownian motion, aluminum sulfate coagulation, and activated carbon filtration are utilized, giving some data as:
Detected Water Type:
Total Heavy Metals:
Carbonate Required:
Aluminum Sulfate Required:
Estimated Filtration Time:
